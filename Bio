I am Yu Liu who is a graduate student from NEU, majored in computer science.

I am a solid software developer with a bunch of development experience in Java/C#. I have worked at a tech company as a software developer intern. During my intern, I developed a database management system and some websites. 

My experiences contribute to my skill of software development, database management and web development. I think those skills have a good match with this position. Besides, I have learned OOD (Object Oriented Design) and Software developing management which help me meet the requirement.
